# Hierarchical clustering as a quality control mechanism to reduce variation in laser inscribed graphene electronics
Laser-inscribed graphene (LIG), initially developed for graphene supercapacitors, has found widespread use in the biological study, particularly in sensor fabrication applications. However, the significant batch-to-batch variation in LIG production introduces uncertainty that cannot be adequately tracked during the manufacturing process. The code ("electrode selection algorithm.Rmd") here is an open-source hierarchical clustering tool for QC analysis in LIG manufacturing for electrochemical sensing. The input of this program is the CV data as shown in the example data

Additionally, the R program "read.Rmd" is designed for reorganized the original data file from the CV testing machine
